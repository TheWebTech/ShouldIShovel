    <h1>About Should I Shovel</h1>
    <p>
        Should I shovel was created by a lazy person for lazy people. Don't get me wrong I have no ill-intentions, I don't intend to piss off neighbors or make it difficult for people using wheelchairs or walking aids to traverse my sidewalk or driveway. That said I don't want to waste my time, energy and back shoveling when it's not necessary. 
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>So the purpose of Should I shovel, is to tell you based on your current and future weather conditions whether it is necessary/worth it to clear your sidewalk, your driveway, patio, or deck.</p>
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>I take your privacy very seriously, if you approve sharing your location to ShouldIShovel, your location is sent directly to the weather service and nowhere else. That location is used to get your current and future weather, which is required for Should I Shovel to work. We don't sell your data, we have no interest in that. We use your location pulled via the location API exclusively for the weather api. We use Google Analytics like most sites on the web, this is to allow us to work with sponsors, improve the site.</p>
    <h2>What about Local Laws</h2>
    <p>Eventually I plan to have a page that lists local laws atleast per State in the U.S. to allow you to see what your local government requires you to do regarding clearing snow from pedestrian or vehicle areas. For now I suggest Googling your cities snow removal requirements. The app does not take your local laws into account, that said it is designed to encourage you to remove your snow if the snow will not go away within a day or two, most cities give you 48 hours.</p>
    <h2>Who made this?</h2>
    <p>My name is Jon McLaren. I'm a web developer that lives in a suburb of Milwaukee Wisconsin, USA. I've lived in the midwest my whole life, grew up playing hockey, shoveling, and snow blowing.</p>
